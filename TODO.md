# To Do

# Old
#file_name = input("Please enter the name of the file you want to convert > ")
# TODO: this should print the supported encoding/decoding formats
#convert_type = input("Please enter the file extension of the image type you want to convert to (png, jpeg) > ")
#converter.convert(file_name, convert_type, None)

# TODO: think a lot about the different types of inputs:
# - input folder
# - input file (relative/absolute)

# - output folder (change input file/folder path to output folder)
# - output folder not specified (put in a new "converted images" folder in cwd)
# - output file specified (relative/absolute, only works for single file)

# - output file type
# - output file type options - quality, compression level, etc - depends on the file type
# TODO: maybe allow multiples inputs? e.g. multiple folder locations + multiple file locations
# TODO: should be fast and easy to use
